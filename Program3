3.	Design Deploy and Manage Microservice Architecture using Docker
Aim: To simulate deployment of basic microservice 
Pre-reuisite: docker desktop has to be installed on system
Steps:
STAY IN DESKTOP
If docker desktop is not downloaded download it(choose 64 bit), mostly it will be downloaded, if its not ask them for internet connection
Go to this on google browser: https://hub.docker.com/signup
Docker hub account: username:1by22cs194@bmsit.in
                                      Password:kinsella1234$
Then go to file explorer create folder microservice-app
Inside app folder:
1.	
2.	App. Py (a in small):
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Microservice App!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

2.Requirements.txt(r in small):
flask
 3.DockerFile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Then one more file (not in app folder)
docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: sampledb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

And one empty file db (not under anything)
In vs code terminal run:
docker compose up –build
 you will get one link go to that link:Hello From Microservice App!
Now if you go on docker desktop click on containers you should see all this
docker-compose down
YOU CAN STOP HERE. IF MA’AM TELLS ANYTHING JUST TELL HER IT WAS GIVEN TILL HERE IN MAUAL, IF MORE TIME IS THERE THEN DO OTHER STEPS.
Next step, is pushing to docker hub
Click start-type cmd
cd path\to\microservice-app
docker build -t yourusername/microservice-app ./app (username is 1BY22CS194)
docker login
docker push yourusername/microservice-app
YOU CAN ALSO RUN IT ON YOUR VS CODE TERMINAL
MAKE SURE DOCKER DESKTOP IS RUNNING BEFORE THIS: GO TO START->DOCKER DESKTOP->OPEN IT->WAIT UNTIL IT IS SAYING “Docker Engine is running”
Then go to docker hub repository:
Go to this link: https://hub.docker.com/
Login into your account
Click your username->repositories
Your microservice app respository should be located inside your account
Viva:
docker-compose up --build Builds and starts all services defined in the Compose file
docker ps Lists all running containers (for verification)
docker-compose down Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes created
NOW SEE IN CASE WINDOWS DOES NOT HAVE DOCKER DESKTOP
USE UBUNTU
STEPS:
1.Open ubuntu in VMWare
2.Install Docker+ Compose in Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
3.	Check Docker
docker –version
docker compose version
4.	Then do same project folder in vs code
5.	In ubuntu terminal run:
docker compose up –build
Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
Go to ubuntu firefox and put it
THIS IS MUCH EASIER IS MA’AM ACCEPTS DO THIS
IF YOU HAVE TO PUSH TO DOCKER HUB FROM UBUNTU:
docker build -t yourusername/microservice-app ./app
docker login
docker push yourusername/microservice-app
