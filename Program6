6.	Build and Run a Java Application with Maven. Migrate the same Application to Gradle. Create a Maven Project. Understand the POM file, Dependency Management and Plugins.
First do program 5 that is only part 1
Part 2:
Install Gradle:
Link: https://gradle.org/releases/
Download binary-only ZIP
•  Extract to:
C:\Gradle\gradle-8.7 (or whatever version you downloaded)
Set environment variables (command prompt as admintrator):
setx GRADLE_HOME "C:\Gradle\gradle-8.7" /M
setx PATH "%PATH%;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin" /M
 Restart CMD and check:
gradle -v

Delete pox.xml file
del pom.xml

Create build.gradle in demo-project/
plugins {
    id 'java'
}
group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}

java {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

Create settings.gradle:
rootProject.name = 'demo-project'

Folder structure should know look like:
 
Build and Run using Gradle
In VS Code Terminal:
gradle build
java -cp build/libs/demo-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
Output:
✅ Hello from Maven Project!
