2.	Docker Installation and Deployment
Method 1: In ubuntu terminal
Okay first make sure vs code is installed(steps are given in above program start)
Now in terminal put these commands to install docker(we need internet connection):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Check if docker is installed:
sudo docker –version
Next, try ubuntu image:
sudo docker run -it ubuntu
type ls
exit
Manage containers:
sudo docker ps -a #show all containers
sudo docker rmi <name>  # Remove an image
Then in files create a new folder:flask-docker
Inside that in vs code:
App.py: (a is in small)
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Docker!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

requirements.txt:
flask
Dockerfile:
FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
The build and run(put in ubuntu terminal):
cd flask-docker #go to that folder #make sure you copy correct path otherwise it will say no such file exists.
sudo docker build -t flask-app . #if it doesn’t work add sudo before docker
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app
You will see: http://localhost:5000 paste this link in file explorer->google(if you want)

Method 2: Now suppose there is docker desktop, okay so everything will happen in windows and not ubuntu
  First check if docker desktop is running:
Open terminal(you can use vs code terminal or regular terminal) and run:
systemctl start docker  #add sudo first if its not working
Then open vs code on desktop, do everything same as before
Then open terminal in vs code and put this:
docker build -t flask-app
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app
Open firefox and go to the same link as above.
If you want to see the blue white box open docker desktop:
And in containers tab and images tab you should see it.
If container is not running rerun on terminal: 
docker ps -a
docker start <container_id_or_name>
docker ps
This is your path in vs code terminal:
cd ~/Desktop/flask-docker
You don’t have to keep this open from start.
For viva:
docker ps -a             # See all containers
docker stop <id>         # Stop a running container
docker rm <id>           # Remove container
docker images            # View images
docker rmi <image-name>  # Delete image
