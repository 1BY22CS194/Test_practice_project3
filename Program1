Program 1:
1.	Version Control Using Git in Browser(open github inside firefox of ubunut->google )
Objective: Learn to use GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket to manage projects.
First do this:
Now install vs code in ubuntu.
Put download vs code for linux choose .deb one and start download
Then go on ubuntu terminal and put this command: 
cd ~/Downloads
sudo apt install ./code*.deb
Now search it should be there.
Or else for getting vs code:
sudo snap install code –classic #install
code #open
Inside vs code put some basic html file(inside some folder):
Index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from VS Code!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
Lab Steps:
1. Sign Up at GitHub or GitLab.
2. Create a New Repository:
o Click New Repository.
o Provide a name and description.
o Add a README.md file.
3. Upload Files Manually(open that folder with index.html in vs code)
o Click Add File > Upload File.
o Select files and commit changes.
4. Modify Files Online:
o Open a file and click Edit.(just add another tag at the top)
o Make changes and commit.
5. Check File History:
o Open a file and click History.
Expected Output:
• A version-controlled project with a history of changes.

Version Control Using Git with Push and Pull Commands
Objective: Use Git for version control from the terminal.
Lab Steps:
a) Install Git (if not installed):
b) sudo apt update
c) sudo apt install git -y
d) Configure Git:
e) git config --global user.name "Your Name" //1BY22CS194
f) git config --global user.email   “you@example.com “
g) Clone an Existing Repository:
h) git clone <repository_url>  //go to code green box in repository copy that link
i) cd <repo_name> //don’t put <> the brackets
j) Modify a File & Commit Changes:
k) echo "New changes" >> file.txt
l) git add .
m) git commit -m "Updated file"
n) Push to Remote Repository:
o) git push origin main
okay now when you put this, it will ask to give your username and password of github account, now even if you put correct password it will say failed to authenticate.
So you have to generate token. Now for this, go to settings not repository your personal(under you account)->there go to develop setting-> and there there will be generate token option
There go to generate new token option and choose the classic one
Under note put name of token:GitUbuntuPush
And then on select scopes click on repo.
And then click on generate token.(make sure you scroll down and select/click on that green generate token button)
You will get some code(won’t be too long) copy it immediately, it won’t be showed again.
Now put git push origin main again
Then for username: 1BY22CS194
Password: put that token you copy (ctrl+shift+v) first hold/click ctrl and shift normally and then hold/click on v. okay and then enter(you won’t see anything that’s normal)
p) Pull Latest Changes:
q) git pull origin main
Expected Output:
• Changes should be reflected on GitHub/GitLab.(you should see file.txt under your repository)
